"""Campaign report assembler — NECS + gene/protein backbones (the deferred follow-on).

Distinct from ``assemble.py`` (the Hajjar internal report) in three ways, each a Hajjar
calibration learning folded in:

  1. **One accuracy number per dataset, no per-vocab axis.** The Hajjar run proved
     ``chosen_kg_id`` is annotation-driven, not vocab-steered, so a per-vocab heatmap is
     uninformative. Each dataset contributes exactly one headline accuracy.
  2. **Two arms, two correctness rules.** Metabolite (NECS) uses the structure oracle and
     reports BOTH the strict InChIKey-first-block accuracy AND the charge/protonation-normalized
     accuracy. Gene/protein (backbones) uses CURIE equality (Top-1 + coverage/precision/recall/F1).
  3. **No competitor figure/column.** NECS and the backbones have NO published same-set
     competitor numbers, so — unlike Hajjar — only BioMapper-vs-reference/oracle is reported.
     Nothing is fabricated (no S2, no per-tool spread).

Internal only; never invokes /publish-wiki. Every number is sourced from a validated results
bundle passed in — nothing is typed by hand.

# i.e. some lipid misses ARE charge-state differences. Lipids with fixed-charge headgroups (e.g. the
# phosphocholine [O-]...[N+] of glycerophospholipids) can carry an explicit charge in the source
# SMILES that shifts the InChIKey first block relative to the KG's neutral form; neutralizing charge
# collapses those. So the two columns may DIFFER — read strict as the conservative floor and the gap
# (strict -> charge-normalized) as protonation/charge-state recoveries, not connectivity fixes.
