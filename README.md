# biomapper

Python client for the **BioMapper2 API** — map biological entity names to
standardized knowledge-graph identifiers (CHEBI, HMDB, PubChem, RefMet, and more).

```python
from biomapper import map_entity

result = map_entity("L-Histidine")
print(result.primary_curie)     # RM:0129894
print(result.confidence_tier)   # high
print(result.ids_for("CHEBI"))  # ['15971']
print(result.equivalent_ids_for("HMDB"))  # ['HMDB0000177']
```

---

## Installation

```bash
# Core (async HTTP client + Pydantic models)
pip install biomapper

# With the external benchmark suite
pip install 'biomapper[benchmarks]'
```

The benchmark suite requires **1.5.2 or later**. The `benchmarks` extra resolves on earlier
releases but `biomapper.benchmarks` does not exist before 1.5.2, so the install succeeds and the
import fails.

---

## Getting an API key

The BioMapper2 API requires an API key. To request access, email
[trent.leslie@phenomehealth.org](mailto:trent.leslie@phenomehealth.org).

Once you have a key, set it in your environment:
```bash
export BIOMAPPER_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Or add it to a `.env` file in your project root:
```
BIOMAPPER_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

biomapper will pick it up automatically from either location.

---

## Quick start

### Single lookup (synchronous)

```python
from biomapper import map_entity

result = map_entity("L-Histidine")

print(result.resolved)          # True
print(result.primary_curie)     # RM:0129894
print(result.chosen_kg_id)      # CHEBI:15971
print(result.chosen_kg_id_review)  # None  (or 'divergent_refmet' when a ChEBI conflict is flagged for review)
print(result.confidence_score)  # 2.489
print(result.confidence_tier)   # high  (≥2.0)
print(result.ids_for("CHEBI"))  # ['15971']
print(result.ids_for("refmet_id"))  # ['RM0129894']

# KG equivalent IDs — all identifiers from the resolved knowledge graph node
print(result.kg_equivalent_ids)            # {'CHEBI': ['15971', '44637'], 'HMDB': ['HMDB0000177'], ...}
print(result.equivalent_ids_for("HMDB"))   # ['HMDB0000177']
```

### Batch mapping (synchronous)

```python
from biomapper import map_entities, summarize

records = [
    {"name": "L-Histidine"},
    {"name": "Glucose", "identifiers": {"HMDB": "HMDB00122"}},
    {"name": "Sphinganine"},
]

results = map_entities(records, progress=True)  # tqdm bar with [notebook]
summary = summarize(results)

print(f"{summary.resolved}/{summary.total_queried} resolved")
print(f"Resolution rate: {summary.resolution_rate:.1%}")
print(summary.vocabulary_coverage)
```

Inputs are auto-chunked at 1000 entities per request against the native
`POST /map/batch` endpoint, so 10,000 records cost 10 round-trips.

### Dataset upload (synchronous)

For larger inputs, hand the server a TSV/CSV file directly and stream
results back. The server processes the file row-by-row over the
`POST /map/dataset/stream` endpoint:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from biomapper import map_dataset_file_sync

result = map_dataset_file_sync(
    Path("compounds.tsv"),
    name_column="name",
    provided_id_columns=["hmdb_id"],
    progress=True,         # tqdm bar
    total_hint=1000,       # optional; enables % progress
)
result.raise_for_error()   # opt-in: raise BioMapperError if the stream truncated
print(f"resolved {sum(1 for r in result.results if r.resolved)} of {len(result.results)}")
```

`name_column` and `provided_id_columns` are required — the server uses
them to map your file's columns to entity names and identifier hints.
For per-result streaming into a UI or custom processing, use the async
`BioMapperClient.map_dataset_file_iter` method (see the tutorial
notebook in `notebooks/`).

### Discovering what the API supports

```python
from biomapper import list_annotators, list_vocabularies, list_entity_types

for a in list_annotators():
    print(f"{a.slug:30s} {a.name}")

# 300+ supported vocabularies (CHEBI, HMDB, PubChem, …)
vocabs = list_vocabularies()
print(f"{len(vocabs)} vocabularies supported")

# Biolink entity types with aliases and default vocabulary prefixes
for et in list_entity_types():
    print(f"{et.type}: {', '.join(et.aliases)}")
    if et.default_prefixes:
        print(f"  prefixes: {', '.join(et.default_prefixes)}")
```

### Tuning resolution

The mapping calls accept the API's resolution options as keyword arguments. An option you do not
pass is **omitted from the request**, so the server's own default applies and the payload is
unchanged for callers who ignore them.

Coverage is uneven, so check this before reaching for one. Passing an option to a call that does
not accept it raises `TypeError` locally, before any request:

| | `vocab` | `prefer_human` | `prefer_canonical` | `candidate_limit` | `kestrel_top_n` | `array_delimiters` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `map_entity`, `map_entities` (sync and async) | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `BioMapperClient.map_dataset_file_iter` (async) | yes | yes | yes | yes | yes | no |
| `map_dataset_file_sync` | yes | no | no | no | no | no |

`array_delimiters` is absent from the dataset routes because the API does not accept it there. The
four missing from `map_dataset_file_sync` are a gap in that wrapper rather than an API limitation:
the async `map_dataset_file_iter` underneath it does accept them, so use that directly if you need
them on a file-based run.

```python
from biomapper import map_entity  # map_entity / map_entities accept all six

result = map_entity(
    "PC 34:1",
    vocab="refmet",             # restrict to one vocabulary (or a list)
    prefer_human=False,         # gene/protein: allow a non-human ortholog to win
    prefer_canonical=False,     # non-gene: allow a non-canonical-namespace node to win
    candidate_limit=20,         # candidates each Kestrel search annotator retrieves (1..100)
    array_delimiters=["|"],     # how delimited ID strings are split
    kestrel_top_n=5,            # opt in to raw Kestrel passthrough rows (1..100)
)
```

| Option | Applies to | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `vocab` | all | server | `str` or `list[str]`, e.g. `"refmet"` |
| `prefer_human` | gene/protein | `True` (server) | Prefer the human, HGNC-bearing candidate over a wrong-species ortholog |
| `prefer_canonical` | non-gene | `True` (server) | Prefer the canonical-namespace node (CHEBI/HMDB/RefMet) over a same-text node from UMLS/ICD/KEGG |
| `candidate_limit` | all | server | 1..100. Validated client-side, so an out-of-range value raises `ValueError` before the request |
| `kestrel_top_n` | all | off | 1..100. Passthrough only: it **never** changes `chosen_kg_id`, `assigned_ids` or the certificate |
| `array_delimiters` | `map_entity`, `map_entities` | `[",", ";"]` | Not accepted by the dataset routes |

`kestrel_top_n` populates `result.kestrel_results` with the raw rows Kestrel returned, exactly as
returned, for each search endpoint the pipeline used. Those rows are **untrusted external data**:
treat every field as unescaped and unverified.

### Resolution certificates and refusal

A mapping result carries the structural certificate the API computed for `chosen_kg_id`, which is
how you tell "we could not check this" apart from "we checked and disagree".

```python
result = map_entity("cortisone")

cert = result.certificate
if cert is not None:
    print(cert.state)                    # corroborated | uncorroborated | contradicted |
                                         # unavailable | not_applicable
    print(cert.independent_source)       # registry consulted, e.g. "pubchem"
    print(cert.independent_of_selection)  # False => corroboration would be circular
    print(cert.refmet_availability)      # voted | no_match | unavailable | not_queried

# Why the resolver declined, when it did. Distinct from `error`:
# an error means the call failed; a refusal means the pipeline ran and declined to assert.
print(result.refusal_reason)
```

`state="contradicted"` means a human should look, not that the resolver is wrong: a name lookup at
an external registry can itself return a related-but-different compound. `state="unavailable"`
means there was nothing to check against, which is unverifiable rather than wrong.

### Async usage

```python
import asyncio
from biomapper import BioMapperClient

async def main() -> None:
    async with BioMapperClient() as client:
        # Verify connectivity
        health = await client.health_check()
        print(health)  # {'status': 'healthy', ...}

        # Single
        result = await client.map_entity(
            "L-Histidine",
            identifiers={"HMDB": "HMDB00177"},
        )

        # Batch — auto-chunked at 1000 entities per request
        results = await client.map_entities(
            [{"name": "L-Histidine"}, {"name": "Glucose"}],
            progress=True,
        )

        # Stream from a file — per-result as they arrive
        from pathlib import Path
        async for r in client.map_dataset_file_iter(
            Path("compounds.tsv"),
            name_column="name",
            provided_id_columns=["hmdb_id"],
        ):
            print(r.query_name, r.primary_curie)

asyncio.run(main())
```

`map_dataset_file_iter` is the primitive for UIs and custom processing that
want per-result reactivity. Callers needing a blocking, fully-collected
result should use `map_dataset_file_sync` instead (see above).

### Jupyter notebooks

Apply `nest_asyncio` before using sync helpers inside a running event loop:

```python
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()  # required in Jupyter

from biomapper import map_entities
results = map_entities([{"name": "L-Histidine"}], progress=True)
```

### Preprocessing functions

```python
from biomapper.extras.metabolon import clean_compound_name, extract_hmdb_id

# Strip quotes and collision-energy suffixes
clean_compound_name('"1,3-Diphenylguanidine_CE45"')  # '1,3-Diphenylguanidine'
clean_compound_name('"4,6-DIOXOHEPTANOIC ACID"')     # '4,6-DIOXOHEPTANOIC ACID'
clean_compound_name('L-Histidine')                   # 'L-Histidine'  (unchanged)

# Extract HMDB accessions from ms1_compound_name format
extract_hmdb_id('HMDB:HMDB03349-2257 L-Dihydroorotic acid')  # 'HMDB03349'
extract_hmdb_id('HMDB00177')                                  # 'HMDB00177'
extract_hmdb_id(None)                                         # None
```

## Harmonization (cross-dataset equivalence)

`biomapper.harmonize` links two **already-resolved** datasets locally. Two entities, one per
cohort, are equivalent when they resolve to the same canonical KRAKEN node. It is an
identifier-set intersection, never string matching, and it runs entirely on the client: no extra
requests, no knowledge-graph access, so it works offline and is fully testable without a network.

```python
from biomapper import map_entities
from biomapper.harmonize import harmonize

ukbb    = map_entities([{"name": "Glucose"},   {"name": "Urea"}])
arivale = map_entities([{"name": "D-glucose"}, {"name": "X-12345"}])

report = harmonize(ukbb, arivale, a_label="ukbb", b_label="arivale")

report.n_links          # 1
report.links[0].shared  # frozenset({'CHEBI:17234', 'KEGG:C00031'}) — what formed the link
report.b_unresolved     # ('X-12345',) — a refusal candidate, never silently dropped
report.summary()
```

Two rules the linker is built around:

1. **Identifier-only.** `INCHIKEY`, `INCHI` and `SMILES` are excluded. Linking on a structure
   hash would make any downstream structural certificate circular and would make precision 100%
   by construction.
2. **Prefix synonyms normalize.** `KEGG.COMPOUND:C00031` equals `KEGG:C00031`; genuinely
   different identifier spaces such as `KEGG.GLYCAN` stay distinct.

An entity that resolved to nothing is a **refusal candidate, not a link**. It is named in
`a_unresolved` / `b_unresolved`, counted in `summary()`, and left out of the link-rate
denominator so non-resolution is never scored as non-equivalence. An entity whose mapping call
errored is tracked separately again in `a_errors` / `b_errors`.

Import it as `from biomapper.harmonize import harmonize`. The name is deliberately not bound on
the package root, where it would shadow the submodule.

| `chosen_kg_id` | `str \| None` | Resolver-selected knowledge graph ID |
| `chosen_kg_id_review` | `str \| None` | Review flag for source-weighted small-molecule ChEBI conflicts: `"divergent_refmet"`, `"conflict_no_structure"`, or `None` |
| `confidence_score` | `float \| None` | Highest score across annotators |
| `confidence_tier` | `str` | `"high"` (≥2.0) / `"medium"` (1–2) / `"low"` (<1) / `"unknown"` |

| `kg_equivalent_ids` | `dict[str, list[str]]` | All equivalent IDs from the resolved KG node, by CURIE prefix |
| `certificate` | `ResolutionCertificate \| None` | Structural certificate for `chosen_kg_id` (state, independent source, RefMet provenance) |
| `refusal_reason` | `str \| None` | Why the resolver declined, read from the certificate. `None` when there is no certificate |
| `lipid_resolution` | `LipidResolution \| None` | Lipid hierarchy detail (goslin parse, `mapping_relation`); `None` for non-lipid rows |
| `refmet_availability` | `str` | `"voted"` / `"no_match"` / `"unavailable"` / `"not_queried"` |
| `refmet_source` | `str` | `"local_snapshot"` / `"not_in_snapshot"` / `"live_api"` / `"unavailable"` / `"not_queried"` |
| `refmet_snapshot_version` | `str \| None` | Pinned RefMet freeze that served the row |
| `tier_b_snapshot_version` | `str \| None` | Tier B freeze that produced a frozen independent result |
| `kestrel_results` | `list[KestrelSearchResult] \| None` | Raw passthrough rows; only when `kestrel_top_n` was set |
| `hmdb_hint` | `str \| None` | HMDB hint passed in the request |

result.ids_for("CHEBI")        # ['15971']
result.ids_for("refmet_id")    # ['RM0129894']
result.ids_for("PUBCHEM.COMPOUND")  # []

# KG equivalent IDs — all identifiers from the resolved knowledge graph node
result.equivalent_ids_for("HMDB")  # ['HMDB0000177']
result.equivalent_ids_for("LM")   # ['ST01010001', 'ST01010093']
```

### `DatasetMappingResult`

Return type of `map_dataset_file_sync`. Captures per-row results plus an
opt-in error signal for partial runs.

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `results` | `list[MappingResult]` | Per-row mapping outcomes in server-emitted order |
| `stats` | `dict[str, Any]` | Server-provided summary. Empty unless the stream emits a terminal summary line |
| `metadata` | `ApiMetadata` | Request metadata; stays at defaults when the stream truncates before completion |
| `error` | `str \| None` | Mid-stream transport failure text. `None` on clean runs |

```python
result.raise_for_error()   # raises BioMapperError if .error is set; else no-op
```

`raise_for_error` mirrors `httpx.Response.raise_for_status` and turns the
partial-result contract into an explicit caller opt-in — silent consumption
of a truncated run (using `.results` without checking `.error`) is the
footgun this model is designed to prevent.

> **Note:** `confidence_score` on dataset-stream results is always `None` —
> the `/map/dataset/stream` endpoint emits a slimmer per-row payload than
> `/map/batch` and does not include the annotator `assigned_ids` block.
> Use `map_entity` / `map_entities` if you need confidence tiers.

### Confidence tiers

| Score | Tier | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 2.0 | `high` | Accept without review |
| 1.0–2.0 | `medium` | Quick sanity check |
| < 1.0 | `low` | Manual review recommended |
| `None` | `unknown` | No score returned (e.g. HMDB-hint resolved) |

### Error handling

```python
from biomapper import (
    BioMapperError,       # base class
    BioMapperAuthError,   # 401/403 — bad API key
    BioMapperRateLimitError,  # 429 — throttled
    BioMapperServerError,     # 5xx
    BioMapperTimeoutError,    # request timeout
    BioMapperConfigError,     # missing API key / bad config
)

try:
    result = map_entity("Glucose")
except BioMapperRateLimitError as e:
    print(f"Throttled. Retry after: {e.retry_after}s")
except BioMapperAuthError:
    print("Check your BIOMAPPER_API_KEY")
```

In batch mode (`map_entities`), per-record errors are caught and returned as
`MappingResult(error=...)` rather than aborting the batch.

Dataset streaming (`map_dataset_file_sync`) uses a two-tier contract:

- **Initial-request errors** (401, 422, 500, connect timeout) raise as typed
  exceptions — these happen before any row is processed, so partial results
  don't exist to preserve.
- **Mid-stream transport failures** are captured into
  `DatasetMappingResult.error` with the partial results preserved in
  `.results`. Call `.raise_for_error()` to get exception semantics, or
  inspect `.error` directly for "accept partial, log the rest" workflows.

Callback exceptions raised from `on_result` propagate unwrapped and
**replace the return value** — partial results collected up to that point
are lost. For UI consumers with failure-prone callbacks, wrap the callback
body in your own try/except if you want partial data to survive.

---

## External benchmark suite

An API-only reproduction harness for the benchmarks the BioMapper preprint reports. It runs
against a **deployment**, not a local engine checkout, which matters for two reasons: running
in-process against a checkout measures a library rather than the deployed service, and pointing at
a deployment pins provenance to the backend that actually served the answers.

```bash
pip install 'biomapper[benchmarks]'

python -m biomapper.benchmarks list                 # the 11 arms and the 2 deliberate skips
python -m biomapper.benchmarks all                  # all arms, production endpoint
python -m biomapper.benchmarks arm hajjar           # a single arm
python -m biomapper.benchmarks --endpoint dev all   # dev, for testing
```

The public KRAKEN endpoint is keyless, and a BioMapper2 deployment with no keys configured is
open, so the suite runs unauthenticated by default. Set `BIOMAPPER_API_KEY` if your deployment
requires one; the key is never accepted on the command line, because argv is visible to other
processes and lands in shell history.

### The arms

| Arm | Input | Metric | Reportable as |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hajjar` | metabolite name | InChIKey structure oracle, strict + KG-equivalence-set | accuracy candidate |
| `necs` | metabolite name | structure oracle, strict + charge-normalized | accuracy, with the gold caveat |
| `srm1950` | metabolite name | structure oracle (gold derived from certified SMILES) | accuracy candidate |
| `metlinkr` | metabolite name | curator cross-link agreement + structural concordance | accuracy candidate |
| `metabench` | mixed ID→ID and name→ID | CURIE equality over 1,000 grounding pairs | partly circular |
| `metaboliteannotator` | metabolite name | name-hit rate, per ion mode | coverage by construction |
| `refmet` | metabolite name | structure oracle | coverage |
| `lmsd` | lipid name | shorthand resolvability, floor-gated | coverage (capability regression) |
| `hgnc` | gene symbol | CURIE equality **per target namespace** | coverage |
| `nlmgene` | gene mention | accuracy (unambiguous) + flag rate (ambiguous) | accuracy candidate |
| `swisslipids` | lipid name | — | currently unsourceable, reports as skipped |

**Read the `Reportable as` column before quoting anything.** Four of the graph's ingested sources
(`lipidmaps`, `refmet`, `loinc`, `ncbigene`) are gold sources for arms above, so those arms measure
coverage, not independent accuracy: the gold identifier and BioMapper's answer come from the same
place. Each run labels every arm from the build's own source list rather than from a static note,
so the label tracks the graph.

Two further reporting rules the suite enforces rather than documents:

- **Gene arms report accuracy per target namespace.** The any-namespace roll-up is emitted flagged
  `quotable: false`, because the namespaces perform very differently and the roll-up has been
  quoted as though it described all of them.
- **A skipped arm is not a zero and not a pass.** It carries a reason into the manifest.

### Provenance

Every run records what actually served it, read from Kestrel `/health` (keyless) rather than
hardcoded: `kestrel_version`, `kg_version`, `biolink_version`, `build_timestamp`, `git_commit`, the
full `source_versions` map, the package version, each dataset's source SHA, and a run id. The build
is read once before the arms start and re-read afterwards; if it moved mid-suite, the manifest says
so, because the pins would no longer describe every number.

Results are saved by default to a timestamped directory (override with `--out`). There is no flag
that discards them: the expensive part of a run is live API traffic.

### What stayed in the engine repo

The CI regression gates (`gate.py`, `conflation_gate.py`, `test_regression_gate.py`,
`kg-regression.yml`) guard merges and need engine internals. The `--resolver-mode {weighted,vote}`
A/B toggles a resolver constructor argument that is deliberately not on the API surface.
