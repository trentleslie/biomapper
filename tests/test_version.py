"""The version has exactly one source of truth, and these tests fail if it grows a second.

Background. ``pyproject.toml`` said ``1.5.1`` while ``biomapper/__init__.py`` said ``1.4.0``, and
the newest tag was ``v1.4.0``. Three answers to "what version is this?" meant no run manifest could
name its own package version unambiguously, and a benchmark number whose client cannot be
identified is a number that cannot be audited.

The fix is that ``pyproject.toml`` is the only place a version literal may appear. Everything else
reads the installed distribution metadata that Poetry builds from it. These tests enforce that,
because a convention nobody checks is a convention that drifts back.
